1. Import the project named HW4_TipCalculator. The project is in a zipped folder on Canvas. You need to download the zipped folder and extract the project files before importing the project.
2. Open the preferences.xml file in the xml directory. Add an EditTextPreference element for a setting named Name. This setting should allow the user to enter his or her full name.
3. Run the app and use the Settings activity to enter your name.
4. Open the XML file for the layout of the activity. Modify the layout, so it includes a fifth row that can display a name.
5. Open the .java file for the Tip Calculator activity. Modify this code so it gets the name from the preferences and displays that name in the fifth row.
6. You will submit the project files through the HW4 assignment link on Canvas. You are required to submit the project files using a zipped folder. To zip your project files, right-click the folder that contains your project files, select Send to, and then click Compressed (zipped) folder. After submitting your assignment, check the submitted zipped file to confirm that it contains all of the project files. Additional information about submitting assignments for the course is available in the Submitting Assignments module on Canvas.
